### Applications for PhD positions

**OPtimization and Trustworthy Machine Learning Group**  
Dr Liu's lab (OTPML Group) at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.msu.edu/) of [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) (MSU) has multiple RA openings. We are looking for strong candidates who are willing to pursue a PhD degree in the direction of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL), optimization theory and methods, computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (Al), with a focus on trustworthy Al (e.g, adversarial robustness, fairness, explainability, ML for security, etc.), and optimization for ML/DL.

**Instructions for Interested candidates** 
You are strongly encouraged to contact Dr. Liu by [email](liusiji5@msu.edu), together with your resume and transcript. A full description of the application instructions can be found at the department website - [Future Graduate Students](https://www.cse.msu.edu/Students/Future_Grad/HowToApply.php). 
<!-- Applicants who would like to start in Spring semester (Jan. 2021) please contact Dr. Liu ASAP. -->

<!-- **About Pl**
Dr. Liu [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C7dO_UgAAAAJ&hl=en) [Website](https://lsjxjtu.github.io) joined @MSU as Assistant Professor in Jan. 2021. From 2018 to 2020, he was a Research Staff Member at MIT-IBM Watson Al Lab, IBM Research. His research interest spans a broad range of areas, e.g, Al, ML/DL, optimization, CV, security, signal processing, and computational biology. His recent research focus is to make Al systems scalable and robust. As datasets, ML/DL models, and learning tasks become increasingly complex, getting ML/DL to scale calls for new advances in optimization methods and ML algorithm design. Moreover, as Al moves from the lab into the real world, ensuring its safety becomes an important requirement prior to its deployment. Dr. Liu's work has been published at top Al conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AISTATS and AAAl. -->
